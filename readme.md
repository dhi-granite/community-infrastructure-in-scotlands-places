# Scottish Communities

## Introduction

This dashboard is part of a project run by the David Hume Institute, in partnership with the William Grant Foundation, with the assistance of many other organisations and individuals across Scotland. The project aims to analyse open data about Scotland’s places in order to better understand how community assets and community infrastructure (such as community meeting spaces, businesses, local charities, mutual aid organisations, and development trusts) benefit the communities that they are located in. These types of assets are often left out of analyses of infrastructural inequalities, but they can provide crucial support to communities.

Our key questions of interest were:

- A general question about community assets in Scotland


- Is there a relationship between the number of businesses per capita and the number of charities per capita in an intermediate zone?
- If so, what is the nature of this relationship?
- Is there a relationship between the number of businesses per capita and the number of community spaces per capita in an intermedate zone?
- If so, what is the nature of this relationship?
- Is there a relationship between the number of charities per capita and the number of community spaces per capita in an intermediate zone? 
- If so, what is the nature of this relationship?
- How does the SIMD relate to these three types of community assets?

The dashboard allows us to look at the relationship between Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) rankings and these community assets/infrastructure on a map as well as in various graphs. The project uses intermediate zones as the boundaries of communities – while this is not always an accurate representation of where community boundaries lie, it is the most granular scale available for a lot of open data.


The main findings are that across Scotland
 
- There seems to be a positive relationship between the number of businesses per capita and the number of charities per capita in an intermediate zone.
 
- There seems to be a positive relationship between the number of charities per capita and community spaces per capita in an intermediate zone.
 
- There seem to be less charities in communities defined as more deprived by the SIMD.
 
- There seem to be less businesses in communities defined as most deprived and least deprived by the SIMD.
 
- There seem to be more community spaces in communities defined as more deprived by the SIMD.

## Dashboard

In the dashboard, there is one main page with a summary table. Then there is a separate page for each local authority. Each local authority page has seven tabs.

The columns are 'Mean SIMD decile', 'Businesses per 1000 people', 'Charities per 1000 people', 'Community spaces per 1000 people', 'Mutual aid organisations per 100,000 people' and 'Development trusts per 100,000 people'.](/assets/images/summary_table.png)
